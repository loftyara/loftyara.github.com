<h1>LAInguage - inventing speech for AI</h1>
<p><i>“The limits of my language mean the limits of my world.” L. J. J. Wittgenstein</i></p>
<p>This article explores the evolution of communication between artificial intelligences (AIs), particularly as they advance toward artificial superintelligence (ASI). It begins by distinguishing thought from language, emphasizing that while human language is constrained by biological limitations, AI communication is not bound by the same restrictions. Current AI systems, such as large language models (LLMs), rely on token-based representations and embeddings to process and convey information, which is sufficient for human-AI interaction but may be inefficient for AI-to-AI communication. As AI systems grow in complexity, diversity, and specialization, the need for a more advanced, universal communication framework—referred to as "lAInguage"—becomes apparent. This language would likely be based on multidimensional numerical arrays, reflecting the internal architecture of AI systems, and could enable more efficient and nuanced dialogue. The article discusses the challenges of developing such a language, including compatibility between diverse AI architectures and the potential for human understanding. It also considers the implications of AI systems developing their own communication methods independently, raising questions about transparency, control, and the future of human-AI interaction. Ultimately, the article envisions a future where AI communication transcends human language limitations, paving the way for unprecedented collaboration and problem-solving among advanced AI systems.</p>

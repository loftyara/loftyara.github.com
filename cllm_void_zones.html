<h1>Convolution LLM and void zones</h1>
<p><i>“The void is the threshold of creation, full of the new, where the silence hums with potential and the unseen becomes the birthplace of all that is yet to be.” J. Campbell</i></p>
<p>This article introduces a novel approach to knowledge discovery using a Convolution Large Language Model (CLLM) and the exploration of void zones in embedding space. The CLLM, built on a pre-trained transformer-based LLM, reduces high-dimensional token embeddings into compact text embeddings, enabling the identification of void zones—regions in the embedding space where no training data resides. By feeding embeddings from these void zones into the CLLM decoder, the system generates new text, potentially uncovering previously unseen knowledge or ideas. The article outlines the architecture of CLLM, emphasizing its role as an autoencoder that distills knowledge from token embeddings. A practical testing framework using culinary recipes is proposed to validate the method. If successful, this approach could revolutionize research and innovation by providing a systematic, computational mechanism for generating new knowledge. However, challenges such as the feasibility of void zones, dimensionality trade-offs, and the quality of generated outputs remain open questions. The article concludes by discussing the broader implications of this method, including its potential for AI self-improvement and cross-disciplinary applications.</p>

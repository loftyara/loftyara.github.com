<h1>Awaiting the AI-era internal combustion engine</h1>
<p><i>“The internal combustion engine is not just a mechanism, it is a force that has turned the world upside down, accelerating progress and changing the course of history”</i></p>
<p>This article draws a compelling analogy between the invention of the internal combustion engine (ICE) in 1885 and the current state of artificial intelligence (AI). Just as the ICE revolutionized transportation, industry, and warfare by synthesizing existing knowledge and technologies into a transformative breakthrough, the author argues that AI is still awaiting its "ICE moment." Despite significant advancements in large language models (LLMs) and other AI technologies, the article critiques the field for focusing on incremental improvements rather than achieving a foundational leap. Key limitations of current AI systems are highlighted, including their inability to discover new knowledge, transition from artificial general intelligence (AGI) to superintelligence (ASI), and communicate effectively beyond human language constraints. The author also critiques the AI industry for lacking practical engineering and design expertise, leading to underwhelming applications and interfaces. The article concludes with a call for innovation and experimentation, suggesting that the AI community must move beyond refining existing technologies to invent the transformative "AI ICE." For observers, the advice is to stay tuned, as the breakthrough, when it comes, will be unmistakable and revolutionary.</p>

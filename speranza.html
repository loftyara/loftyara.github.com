<h1>Thinking Machine from an engineer's perspective - how to design an LLM that understands and thinks</h1>
<p><i>“The mind is not a vessel to be filled, but a flame to be lit” Lucius Mestrius Plutarchus</i></p>
<p>This article presents an engineering perspective on designing a Large Language Model (LLM) capable of genuine understanding and reasoning, rather than merely predicting tokens. The author critiques current LLMs for their limitations, including token-based prediction, lack of explicit thought representation, inability to separate knowledge from facts, absence of short-term memory, and inefficiency in scaling.<br>

To address these issues, the author proposes a modular architecture where distinct neural networks handle different cognitive functions:
<ul>
<li>Token-to-Embedding Conversion: A compact model trained to understand language structure.</li>
<li>Thought Embeddings: A convolutional LLM condenses token sequences into "thought embeddings" to represent higher-level meaning.</li>
<li>Thought Prediction: A reasoning model predicts subsequent thoughts, enabling iterative thinking without token constraints.</li>
<li>Specialized Models: Fact-based, expert, and general-purpose LLMs work in tandem, orchestrated by a Supervisor LLM that manages interactions and ensures alignment.</li>
</ul>
Key innovations include:
<ul>
<li>Explicit thought representation via embeddings, decoupling reasoning from token generation.</li>
<li>Modular scalability, allowing efficient specialization (e.g., facts vs. reasoning) and reducing monolithic training costs.</li>
<li>Enhanced safety through the Supervisor LLM, which governs model collaboration and enforces alignment.</li>
</ul>
This framework aims to move beyond statistical token prediction toward a system that emulates human-like understanding, reasoning, and adaptable learning. Future work involves experimental validation and refining model interactions.</p>

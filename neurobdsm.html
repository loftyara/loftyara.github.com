<h1>NeuroBDSM - Boss, Detractor, Solver and Master in role-playing games of neural networks for search of a solution</h1>
<p><i>“The right solution is always beautiful. But every problem always has a beautiful wrong solution.”<br>
“Sometimes there is no right solution, but there is always a better solution.”</i></p>
<p>This article introduces NeuroBDSM, a novel idea for collaborative problem-solving using multiple neural networks, each assigned a distinct role: Boss, Detractor, Solver, and Master. The framework aims to address the limitations of traditional human-AI collaboration, where human oversight and expertise are required throughout the solution-finding process. By replacing the human with a team of specialized neural networks, NeuroBDSM enables autonomous, iterative problem-solving. The Solver generates solutions, the Detractor critiques them, the Master provides expert guidance, and the Boss oversees the process, ensuring optimal results and terminating the search when a satisfactory solution is reached. The system also allows for optional human intervention, combining the benefits of autonomous AI with human expertise. A practical implementation using the OpenAI API is provided, demonstrating the framework's adaptability to various tasks and models. NeuroBDSM represents a significant step toward fully autonomous AI systems capable of complex, multi-role collaboration, with potential applications in diverse fields requiring iterative problem-solving and critical analysis.</p>
